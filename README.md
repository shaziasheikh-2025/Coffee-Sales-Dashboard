- Checking NULL values, blanks and Errors.
- Removing duplicates, and irrelevant columns.
- Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
- Using Vlookup function to find the customer name, email.country, coffee type, roast type,size unit price, loyalty card from the customers and products table.
- Created “Sales” column by calculation and “Coffee Type Name” and “Roast Type Name” columns by using IF function.

## Data Analysis
3 pivot tables were created to summarise the data and help identify trends in the dataset focusing on relationship between sales and other factors such as date, customers, country.

## Data Visualization
Finally, the dashboard was created by inserting and customizing the pivot charts of corresponding pivot table on a separate sheet named “Dashboard”. For user friendly and interactive experience 3 "Slicers" and 1 “Timeline” were added.
Below is a snippet of the final dashboard in Excel.
